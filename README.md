# Autoview
Automatic viewer renderer by JSON schema and AI agent.




## Benchmark
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wrtnlabs/autoview
code autoview
pnpm install

pnpm run dev  # FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT
pnpm run test # RUN TEST BENCHMARK PROGRAM
```

Above above commands.

Then you can see the benchmark results in both `public/results/json` and `public/results/images` directories.

By the way, as the `pnpm run dev` is a command of incremental build of the frontend application, you have to open at least two terminals, and run both `pnpm run dev` and `pnpm run test` commands in each terminal.
