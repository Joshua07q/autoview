# StackedList

The `StackedList` is a collection of vertically arranged items, where each item follows a consistent structure and style. This ensures users can process information in a structured manner and easily compare or navigate through list items.

- **Systematic Information Delivery:** Groups related information or data to present it in a clear and structured way to users.

## Usage Guidelines

- **Consistent Item Structure:** All items should maintain the same layout and style, allowing users to recognize patterns and quickly grasp information. If structures or styles vary, it may lead to confusion, so consistency is key.

## Application

When displaying repeated data, selecting the appropriate component based on the context is crucial. Below is a comparison of `Accordion`, `Carousel`, `Collapse`, `GridList`, `StackedList`, and `Table` components, highlighting their characteristics and considerations.

### Accordion

- **Characteristics:** Displays multiple sections where only one section can be expanded at a time. Clicking a section header reveals its content.
- **When to Use:** Ideal for displaying multiple content sections sequentially within a limited space.

- **When to Use:** Suitable for highlighting promotional banners, key content, or showcasing visual elements like images or videos.
- **Considerations:** Should support both auto-play and manual navigation while avoiding an excessive number of items.

### Collapse

- **Characteristics:** Allows users to expand or collapse specific content, enabling selective information display.
- **When to Use:** Best for showing supplementary or additional details that users can access on demand.
- **Considerations:** Avoid hiding essential information and prevent excessive nesting.

### GridList

- **Characteristics:** Arranges items in a grid format, typically using card-based layouts to present visually rich content.
- **When to Use:** Suitable for displaying multiple images, videos, or visually engaging content.
- **Considerations:** Maintain consistent item sizes and spacing to ensure a clean and organized layout.

### StackedList

- **Characteristics:** A collection of vertically arranged items, each following a uniform structure and style.
- **When to Use:** Ideal for structured information display, such as contact lists or discussion board entries.
- **Considerations:** Avoid excessive information overload and ensure clear visual separation between items.

### Table

- **Characteristics:** Uses a structured grid of rows and columns to display organized data.
