# Accordion

The `Accordion` component organizes multiple related content sections within a single container, allowing users to expand or collapse each section by clicking its header. This enhances space efficiency and helps group related information for better user experience.

## Usage Guidelines

- **Single Section Open:** Configure the accordion so that only one section can be open at a time. When a new section is opened, the previously open section should automatically close.
- **Clear Headers:** Each section's header should clearly describe its content to help users understand what it contains.

### When Not to Use

- **Hiding Critical Information:** Do not use an `Accordion` to hide essential information that users must see.
- **Nested Accordions:** Avoid using multiple nested `Accordion` components, as this can confuse users.
- **Unnecessary Usage:** Wrapping all content in an `Accordion` can negatively impact user experience. Use it appropriately based on the importance and priority of the information.

## Usage Examples

- **FAQ Section:** Present frequently asked questions in an `Accordion` format, allowing users to click on a question to reveal the answer.
  - Example: *"How long does shipping take?"*, *"What is the return process?"*
- **Product Details:** Organize product specifications, reviews, and Q&A sections using an `Accordion`, enabling users to selectively view the information they need.
  - Example: *"Product Specifications"*, *"User Reviews"*, *"Q&A"*
- **Settings Panel:** Structure the settings menu in an application using an `Accordion`, allowing users to expand only the sections they want to configure.
  - Example: *"General Settings"*, *"Notification Settings"*, *"Privacy Settings"*
- **Mobile Menu:** Implement an `Accordion` in mobile website navigation to save space and help users find their desired menu items easily.
  - Example: *"Category 1"*, *"Category 2"*, *"Category 3"*
