# Carousel

The `Carousel` is a UI component that sequentially displays images or content in a sliding format. Users can navigate through multiple items quickly using left and right arrows or autoplay. This component efficiently utilizes space, enhances visual engagement, and provides diverse information at a glance.

## Usage Guidelines

- **Consistent Item Structure:** All items within the `Carousel` should have the same layout and structure. This ensures that users can easily compare and understand each item.
- **Fixed Number of Items:** `Carousel` is best suited for displaying a fixed number of items. If dynamic content updates or a "Load More" feature is required, consider alternative UI components.
- **Visual Emphasis:** Since `Carousel` grabs visual attention, it should be used to highlight important promotions or key content. It is not suitable for displaying simple lists or text-based data.

### When Not to Use

- **Dynamic Content:** If items are frequently added or updated, a `Carousel` may not be the best choice. Consider using a different UI component for such scenarios.
- **Excessive Number of Items:** Including too many items in a `Carousel` can make it difficult for users to view all the content. Limit the number of items to an appropriate amount.

## Usage Examples

- **Promotion Banners:** Place multiple promotional or event banners in a `Carousel` at the top of a website, allowing users to browse various offers sequentially.
- **Product Image Gallery:** Use a `Carousel` on a product detail page to showcase images of the product from different angles, enabling users to examine it closely.
- **Customer Reviews:** Display user feedback or reviews in a `Carousel` to present various opinions in a compact space.
- **Portfolio Slider:** Organize a designer’s or developer’s portfolio into a `Carousel` to showcase different projects in a sequential manner.
