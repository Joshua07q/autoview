# GridList

The `GridList` component arranges items of the same type in a grid format, helping users efficiently navigate visually rich content. Each item maintains a consistent size and structure and can include various types of content, such as images, text, and icons.

- **Efficient Layout for Visual Content:** Ideal for displaying visually important content such as image galleries or product lists in an easy-to-scan manner.  
- **Optimized Space Utilization:** Organizes multiple items neatly, maximizing screen space efficiency.  
- **Supports Quick Navigation:** Helps users scan and locate desired information quickly.

## Usage Guidelines

- **Consistent Item Size:** All items should maintain the same size and layout to create a well-organized appearance.

### When Not to Use

- **Simple Text Lists:** If the content consists of plain text lists, it is better to use a `StackedList` or `Table` instead of a `GridList`.  
- **Complex Data Structures:** If you need to display detailed data with multiple fields, a `Table` component may be more suitable than `GridList`.  
- **Excessive Number of Items:** Displaying too many items on a single page can overwhelm users. Consider using a `Carousel` to allow users to browse additional items interactively, reducing information overload and fatigue.

## Usage Examples

- **Product Listings:** Arrange multiple products in a grid format on an e-commerce platform to help users compare and choose items efficiently.  
- **Video Thumbnails:** Display video thumbnails in a grid layout, enabling users to browse and select videos quickly.
