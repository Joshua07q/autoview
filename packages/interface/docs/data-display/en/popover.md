# Popover

A `Popover` is a small overlay window that appears when a user clicks or taps on a specific element. It can contain various types of content, such as titles, images, and links, providing additional information or functionality.

- **Detailed Information Display:** Used when more than a brief explanation is needed.
- **Includes Interactive Elements:** Suitable for cases where additional user interaction is required, such as `Button`, `Link`, or `Input` components.

## Usage Guidelines

When using `Popover`, follow these guidelines:

1. **Define a Trigger Element:** `Popover` must be attached to an interactive element like a `Button` or `Icon` that users can click or tap.
2. **Keep Content Concise:** Include only essential information to maintain clarity and avoid excessive content.

### When Other Components Are More Suitable

Compared to a similar component, `Tooltip`, the key difference is in their intended use. A `Tooltip` provides brief supplementary explanations and appears when a user hovers over or focuses on an element. In contrast, `Popover` can contain richer content, appears when a user clicks or taps an element, and supports additional user interactions.

## Examples of Use

- **Detailed Descriptions:** Provides a help message next to an `Icon`, allowing users to access more information about a specific feature.
- **Supplementary Explanations:** Displays detailed information when clicking on a specific data point, especially when the content is too extensive for a `Tooltip`.
