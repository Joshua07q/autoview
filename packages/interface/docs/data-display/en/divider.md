# Divider

A `Divider` creates a visual boundary between different pieces of content or sections, helping users clearly understand the structure of the information.

- **Content Separation:** Groups related information or separates distinct sections to enhance readability.
- **Guiding Visual Flow:** Helps maintain a natural flow of information within a page or screen.

## Usage Guidelines

- **Appropriate Use:** Use `Divider` to separate sections where there is a significant change in content or context. Overuse can cause confusion, so apply it only where necessary to avoid distracting users.
- **Maintaining Consistency:** Ensure consistency in thickness, color, and spacing of `Divider` within the design system to maintain a cohesive UI.
- **Horizontal and Vertical Usage:** `Divider` can be used in both horizontal and vertical orientations. Choose the appropriate direction based on the content layout and flow.

### When Other Components Are More Suitable

Avoid using `Divider` when components already have a clear visual boundary, such as `Card`, `Accordion`, `Collapse`, or `Grid`. These components inherently provide separation, and adding unnecessary `Divider` elements may overcomplicate the design.

## Examples of Use

- **Menu Item Separation:** Helps users navigate a sidebar menu more easily by dividing menu items.
- **List Item Separation:** Improves readability by clearly distinguishing items in a long list.
- **Card Section Separation:** Enhances clarity by segmenting different topics or sections within a card component.
- **Section Separation:** Defines distinct sections within a page, ensuring a structured flow of information.
