By the way, the\n`IShoppingCustomer` does not mean a person, but a connection basis. Therefore,\neven if the same person connects to the shopping mall multiple, multiple\nrecords are created in `IShoppingCustomer`.\n\nThe first purpose of this is to track the customer's inflow path in detail,\nand it is for cases where the same person enters as a non-member,\n{@link IShoppingCartCommodity puts items in the shopping cart} in advance,\nand only authenticates their {@link IShoppingCitizen real name} or\nregisters/logs in at the moment of {@link IShoppingOrderPublish payment}.\nIt is the second.
