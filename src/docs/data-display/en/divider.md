# Divider

The `Divider` component is a key UI element used to visually separate content or sections within a layout.

## Purpose

`Divider` creates a visual boundary between different content areas, helping users understand the structure of information more clearly.

- **Content Separation:** Groups related information together or separates different sections to improve readability.  
- **Guiding Visual Flow:** Ensures a smooth transition between sections, making the information flow naturally within a page or screen.

## Usage Rules

- **Appropriate Use:** Use `Divider` to separate sections where the content or context changes significantly. Excessive use can cause visual clutter, so apply it only where necessary to avoid distractions.  
- **Consistency:** Maintain uniform thickness, color, and spacing within the design system to ensure a cohesive UI experience.  
- **Horizontal vs. Vertical Use:** `Divider` can be applied horizontally or vertically, depending on the layout and content flow.

### When to Use Other Components Instead

Avoid using `Divider` where content boundaries are already clearly defined by other components such as `Card`, `Accordion`, `Collapse`, or `Grid`. These components inherently provide separation, and adding `Divider` unnecessarily can make the design look cluttered.

## Examples of Use

- **Menu Item Separation:** Helps users navigate easily by visually distinguishing menu items in a sidebar.  
- **List Item Separation:** Enhances readability in long lists by providing clear visual breaks.  
- **Card Section Separation:** Defines distinct topics or subsections within a card component.  
- **Page Section Separation:** Differentiates various sections on a page to clarify the flow of information.

Using `Divider` effectively improves UI structure and enhances the clarity of information presentation.
